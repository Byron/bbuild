A cmake based multi-platform build system.

It can be used to build c++ source code with dependencies and to build sphinx and doxygen documentation.

There are helper modules to build pyside uic and resource files.

The idea is to declare everything there is to know about a project, and have the details handled by cmake on all platforms it can support.

Prerequisites
=============

* Cmake 2.8 or newer
